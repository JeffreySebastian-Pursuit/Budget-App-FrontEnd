// JS numbers can be floats (decimals), positive, negative, and etch....
// can do math with number
// NaN (Not a number) is of type Number
// modulo gives you the remainder of the number.
// double equal sign checks if the number and what's inside the string are equal. triple equal sign checks for value.

// String being added to each other is called string concatenation
// we can add strings. strings added to anything become a string.
// backticks(``), double quotes(""), and single quotes ('').

//Booleans are true or false. they are their own data types.

// Coparrison Operations
// === - triple equesls for strict equality match . evaluates to a boolean.
// !== - Not equal to
// Also have <, >, <=, >= for comparisons

// Logical operator 
// ! mean Not
// && AND  (are both sides truthy?) both sides needs to be truthy if not it will give you false.
// || OR (at least one side truthy) the last thing that the computer read, its what printed in the computer.

// things are Truthy or falsy.
// falsy vaules in JS:
// 0 /-0
// false
// NaN
// null
// undefined
// ""

// these will become super important when dealing with conditionals.

"use strict" // cannot accidenetally declares a global value.
// const person = "Jeffrey"
// console.log(person) // will thorw error w/o using const/ strict
//variables
// creating a variable consists of a few parts.
// 1. declaration - const, let var
// 2. variable namedescribe what they are (think nouns)
// 3. assingment of value = (assignment operator) - on the right side give value

// forward slash is considered an escape key.
// command slash for comments
 // if you forget to declare a variable it will automatically become global
// first_name - snakecse - common with languanges like Ruby
// in JS we use camelCase - starts lowercase, each additional word capital

// let firstName = "Jeffrey";
// let lastName = "Sebastian";
// console.log(lastName) 
// lastName = "Tanasootr" // variable re-assignment operator // you cannot reassign a constant variable.

// console.log(lastName) 

//const city ="New York City"; // cannot change the value of the city due to const.
//city = "Chicago";
//console.log(city);

//console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);

//const animal; // declared but not assigned are undefined  and this will not work for const.

//console.log(animal);

// let animal = null; // null is the absense of any value.
// console.log(animal)

//let age = 100;
//console.log(age)


//age = age + 1;
//age += 1 //^ is synonymous - this called syntactic sugar
//console.log(age)

//let num = 7;
//num++; /// num = num -2, /2, *2, ++
//console.log(num);

// const favoriteNum = 13;
// const secondfavNum = 44;

// let sumOfTopTwoNuns = favoriteNum + secondfavNum
// console.log(sumOfTopTwoNuns)

// what is state? - everything that's stored in memory while a program runs.
